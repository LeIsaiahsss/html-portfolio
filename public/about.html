<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><h2>I'm Isaiah, a student just trying to learn how to be a web developer.</h2></p>

<p>I've always had a drive to learn new things everyday. Whether it be simple things such as a hobby or very complex ones like 
  learning a programming language or reading about different kinds of systems. No matter the case, this website will be my progress 
  tracker in learning web devolopment.</p>

<p>Outside of this interest, I normally do video games, singing, playing with my dog, and learning different other stuff.</p>
